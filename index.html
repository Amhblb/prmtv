    <h1>Main Header</h1>

    <h2>Subheader 1</h2>
    <p>
      This is a paragraph under Subheader 1. It contains sample text to
      illustrate how paragraphs appear under subheaders.
    </p>

    <h2>Subheader 2</h2>
    <p>
      This is another paragraph, this time under Subheader 2. It serves the same
      purpose as the previous paragraph but under a new subheader for diversity.
    </p>

    <h2>Subheader 3</h2>
    <p>
      Here is yet another paragraph under Subheader 3. The content doesn't
      matter much; it's all about showing the structure of a basic HTML page.
    </p>
